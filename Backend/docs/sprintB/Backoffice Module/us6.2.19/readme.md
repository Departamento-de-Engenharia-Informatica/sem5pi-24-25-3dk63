# 6.2.19 - Admin: Edit Existing Operation Types

## As an admin, I want to edit existing operation types, so that I can update or correct information about the procedure.

### Acceptance Criteria:
- Admins can search for and locate existing operation types using the operation type name or unique identifier.
- The admin can edit details of the operation type, including the procedure name, description, duration, and any associated resources or equipment.
- The system validates the updated information to ensure it is correct and complete.
- Once changes are made, the system updates the operation type, and all related data across the system is refreshed accordingly.
- The system logs the changes made to the operation type, including who made the edit and when.
- Admins can cancel the editing process at any time without saving the changes.
- The updated operation type information is reflected in the relevant sections of the system (e.g., scheduling, resource management).
- Admins can view a history of changes made to the operation type for tracking purposes.

4. **Update Operation Type**: Ensure that once changes are made, the operation type is updated across the system, including any associated data (e.g., scheduling, equipment requirements).
5. **Change Logging**: Log all changes made to operation types, tracking the adminâ€™s identity and timestamp.
6. **Cancel Changes Option**: Provide an option for admins to cancel the editing process without saving changes.
7. **Testing**: Test the search, editing, validation, updating, and logging functionality to ensure the system works as expected.

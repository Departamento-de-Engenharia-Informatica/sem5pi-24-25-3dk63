# As an Admin, I want to deactivate a staff profile, so that I can remove them from the hospitalâ€™s active roster without losing their historical data.

# Acceptance Criteria:
-Admins can search for and select a staff profile to deactivate.
-Deactivating a staff profile removes them from the active roster, but their historical data (e.g., appointments) remains accessible.
-The system confirms deactivation and records the action for audit purposes.
